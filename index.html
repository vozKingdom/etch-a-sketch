            <p>
                I lost my mind in this game..like Vincent van Gogh. 
                <br>He dedicated his life to his craft and lost his mind in the process. <br>That's happening to me. But, fuck it. 
                <br>When that gold belt is around my waist, 
                <br>when my mother has a big mansion, 
                <br>when my girlfriend has a different car for every day of the week, 
                <br>when my kids' kids have everything they ever want, 
                <br><b>then it will pay.</b>
            </p>
